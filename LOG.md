## May 14 2017 - 10:52 to 11:07
General setup.
Started to read though the basic documentation.
Added a very basic elm file.
Started to read https://dev.to/rtfeldman/tour-of-an-open-source-elm-spa as a reference.

## May 14 2017 - 11:09 to 11:24
Having difficulty with html-to-elm.
Getting error messages about how node is not setup correctly.
Was related to not having a variable assigned

## May 14 2017 - 11:24 to 11:39
Ran into bug because my views directory was named Views.elm.
Added the basic layout and got it working in Main.elm.
Started to try to get the contents of the layout working

## May 15 2017 - 10:02 to 10:17
Started to look into Routing.
Ran into elm-reactor error with intalling a library.
Going to do it according to an elm guide instead


## May 15 2017 - 10:18 to 10:33
Got a little farther but routing is such a hassle in Elm.
Got the basic framework up but still not the basic routing of going to a different url

## May 15 2017 - 10:33 to 10:48
Some links to help with future dealing with routing since I am not taking the time to deeply understand.

https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/07-routing/02-routing.html
http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/url-parser/2.0.1

Also think there is some way to use elm-route but it keeps breaking my repo

## May 15 2017 - 10:52 to 11:07
Starting to look around to resolve the elm-http issue...
Nothing jumps out.
I will have to report an issue tomorrow

## May 15 2017 - 11:14 to 11:29
Finally got the routing working.
It was easy once I started to actually pay attention.
I do think the example could be a little better.

## May 16 2017 - 8:57 to 9:12
Started to import the other views into the product.

## May 16 2017 - 9:13 to 9:28
Continued to work on setting up views.
Tried to input the editor html and it seems to have has some issues on a placeholder.
I should report that.
Also the footer seems to overlap with pages that have a large height.

## May 16 2017 - 10:14 to 10:29
Moved the routes out of Main and into Routes.
Added some data structures that will need to be used with the Views.
Started to look into Json decoding

## May 17 2017 - 6:55 to 7:10
Added a data structure for comments.
Started to use the data structures in the views for Articles.

## May 17 2017 - 8:50 to 9:05
Trying to figure out how to do requests in Elm

## May 17 2017 - 9:06 to 9:21
Figured a basic way of setting up the requests.
I realize that I don't know much about Cmd.
Read https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/03-subs-cmds/02-commands.html

## May 17 2017 - 9:52 to 10:07
Looking into how to decode complex data types.
https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline
Seems like pipline is a better way to go than the default since they only go upto 8 props.
I wonder how you do more than that?
Started to decode the articles object

## May 17 2017 - 10:08 to 10:23
Continue work on decode.
The example docs for elm-decode pipline need to have nullable imported.
Got a basic decode of articles working! Alright!
I think next I will work on displaying those articles correctly.

## May 18 2017 - 9:38 to 9:53
Starting working and from the test server and got a null description.
Started to make templates 

## May 18 2017 - 9:54 to 10:09
Got the basic data from the example app and then iterated to display static data.
Working on making it more dynamic.
Got a lot of the data working.
I am having some issues with the footer css.
I might look at the real app to see what they did.


## May 18 2017 - 10:09 to 10:24
Removed some code that was no longer needed in Views.Main.
Looked at the example app(specifically footer).
So... Apparently I cannot define the HTML for Elm.
That gets defined already...
Changed some of the artibutes but still getting the footer floating weird.

https://gist.github.com/coreytrampe/a120fac4959db7852c0f.
Maybe for external loading?

## May 18 2017 - 10:26 to 10:41
Just fixed a bunch of warnings.
I actually caught some bugs with an article not following the data format it should.
Seems like Elm automatically creates anon types.

## May 18 2017 - 10:41 to 10:56
Back to fixing that stupid footer.
I am just confused.
It must be somehow related to how I am going the head stuff and got the html messed up.
Also not super clear how to use custome html.
There is soemthing about the elm-make and one issue about the elm-reactor but I feel like it should be supported.

## May 18 2017 - 11:00 to 11:15
WHAT IS THIS?
```
@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro);
html, head, body {
  margin: 0;
  height: 100%;
}
```
It is in the head generated by Elm? Or Reactor?
This is the issue!

Fixed it in a hacky way.
I will have to refactor and figure out how to use an external html page.
Also changed the Readme a little.

## May 19 2017 - 9:57 to 10:12
Display the raw timestamp.
Started to work on loading an article from the api.

## May 19 2017 - 10:13 to 10:28
Continued work on getting data from the api for an article

## May 19 2017 - 10:28 to 10:43
Got an article basically loading.
There are some bugs still but there is at least something there.
Looked at my demo reference...
http://rtfeldman.github.io/elm-spa-example/
The description for an article is only for the short article view.
Looking into using elm-markdown... Not sure about classes.

## May 19 2017 - 10:45 to 11:00
Added elm-markdown.
It seems to be right compared to the demo app but I wonder if it works in all cases.
There are specific classes that are in the demo examples.

Look into elm-time for the time handleing.

## May 19 2017 - 11:00 to 11:15
Got a bit into time handeling libraries but elm does everything it turns out!
Just need to format.
The format does not seem to have a "th" or "st" part.
I should request that.

## May 19 2017 - 11:15 to 11:30
Looking at other apps they do it slightly differently.
Which is all different from the template.

Doing some research into how to batch calls to the server for some things.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39392469/how-to-perform-multiple-http-requests-tasks-in-bulk-in-elm-lang
Seems like the solution.

Fixed issue with first loading an article.

## May 20 2017 - 12:13 to 12:28
Going to try to get tags on the main page.
Got them loading in from the server.

## May 20 2017 - 12:29 to 12:42
Got tags displayig.
Have to cut the session short.

## May 20 2017 - 9:20 to 9:35
Going to take some time to refactor and reorganize the code.
Centralized the loading code for different locations.
Hide "Your Feed" if your are not logged in

## May 20 2017 - 9:35 to 9:50
Working on highlighting different parts of the app in the nav bar.
Maybe a little more complex than it needed to be but it is working.

## May 20 2017 - 9:50 to 10:05
Going to try to get profiles loading.
Got them loading and got it setup to get the data for the profile.
I will need to fillout the rest of the profile page with data.
I will also have to load the articles written and liked by the user.

## May 21 2017 - 7:06 to 7:21
Working on getting more data into the profile.
Updated the view a little and also loading in articles written by the profile.
I need to figure out a better way to deal with multiple calls when accessing a page.

## May 21 2017 - 9:10 to 9:25
Work on displaying a users articles.
Got it working I will also have to figure out a way to deal with switching between written articles and favorite articles

## May 21 2017 - 9:25 to 9:40
Fixed issue when you click on a username you get redirected to "profile.html".
Also updated the layout to use the Maybe User to display certain things on the navbar.
I think I will try to get all the non-logged in stuff done or mostly working before trying to figureout the logged in.
I will have to figure out some localstorage stuff for that.

## May 22 2017 - 7:16 to 7:31
Going to look at getting the pagination at the bottom of the main page.
They don't seem to have pagination in their templates.
Got a basic dumb display wokring.
I need to actually hook it up to real values.
I wonder how many articles per page... Maybe the api spec talks about it. 

## May 22 2017 - 7:34 to 7:49
From API the default is `20`.
I also need to get the total number of articles.
Though the example app has `10` per page...
Did some minor fixes to the Sign Up and Sign in pages.
I will probably work on loading in comments on articles next.

## May 22 2017 - 7:50 to 8:05
Added the basic code and functions to decode the comments and store them.

## May 23 2017 - 8:40 to 8:55
Got the comments displaying correctly.
I am going to have to address issues in multiple places with logged in vs non-logged in user

## May 23 2017 - 8:55 to 9:10
On the article page I should hide certain things like follow and favorite post.
Also making comments.
Hide those things.

## May 23 2017 - 9:10 to 9:25
Looking at the example app I realize that I don't have tags on my article previews...
Also to the actual article.

Upto this point I have not actually been setting up certain filters like tags ot pages.
I will have to work on that now.

I also think I have been using logs completely wrong...

## May 24 2017 - 9:13 to 9:28
Worked on preventing the bubleing events when a a link is click.
Sort of a fun jounrey.
Ran into a google groups thread that lead me into looking at the internals of the html.events code.

## May 24 2017 - 9:28 to 9:43
Looking at the example app I see that there needs to be a separate tag on the main page when you click on a side tag...
I am going to work on the profile articles and switching between.

I am trying to think if I want to go though a clean up or not.
Everything is working but I do think I could do some stuff to make it easier to work on.
I am also thinking of centeralizing all strings that are displayed to a user.

## May 25 2017 - 7:08 to 7:23
Add some text if no articles are found in a user's profile.
Also got the tab highlighting working on the profile page.

## May 25 2017 - 7:32 to 7:47
Looking into adding an additional tab on the main page for when a tag is selected.
Need to make it select like it is active.
Then is is on to pagniations.
I also need to have a case for tags + pages.

I also am sort of clueless about the local storage for Elm and authentication.
Maybe I can do that late in the game.
Just keep credentials in the local memory.

## May 26 2017 - 10:12 to 10:27
Just some general clean up.
Ran elm-format
Also ran elm-analyse.
Cleaned up some issues.

## May 26 2017 - 10:28 to 10:43
Continue with using elm-analyse.
Not sure if I agree with everything it recommends(import all from namespace) but it is supercool.
Also Sum types... Maybe a little too far...

## May 27 2017 - 21:55 to 22:10
Added the ability to click a page and get something else to load.
I also need to highlight the currentPage.

## May 28 2017 - 22:22 to 22:37
Going to work on more pagniation stuff.
I think there will always be pagniation on very call.
That way pages work with tags.
I will have to do more work with this

## May 29 2017 - 22:42 to 22:57
Working on getting the paging correct.
Mostly correct I think but not certain.
I guess the next step is Sign in and sign up.
Actually I should fix some issues with a reload being forced.
And highlighting the tag tab when one is selected.

## May 29 2017 - 22:56 to 22:11
Got the tag tab highlighting correctly.
Reviewed the doc for how to log in.
I am just going to store in the elm data structure for now.
I am also going to have to add quth token to the request.

Looking at the sourcecode for elm-http
https://github.com/elm-lang/http/blob/master/src/Http.elm#L159
I will have to implement my own version to get the correct authentication headers.

Added a basic authedGet and will add more in the future.

## May 30 2017 - 22:42 to 22:57
Continue to look into how to do the post and request
https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/user_input/forms.html

Got some new data in the model and new events that will be useful for login

## May 31 2017 - 22:32 to 22:47
Looking more into saving to the backend.

https://github.com/mpizenberg/elm_api_test/blob/master/src/Main.elm

It seems like the data needs to be encoded like it was decoded going back to the server.
Should split the encoders and decoders into modules.

## June 1 2017 - 21:22 to 21:37
Worked on modifications for posting data.

## June 2 2017 - 22:03 to 22:18
Worked on login and got a repsonse back!
I still need to figure out how to redirect after...

## June 2 2017 - 22:20 to 22:35
Ok I am getting an error for some reason on the user login...
It is because my bio is null.

Fixed that and now I am in!
Awesome! There will be a bit of work but I think one of my first things will be to log back out.

Got log out working.
I can already tell it will be annoying login in and out.
I might have to look at the elm implementation to see how it does the ports.
I would rather learn on my own though.

## June 3 2017 - 23:09 to 23:24
Looking into custom html page for getting localstorage working
Looked at the html in the elm-app :(
Will have to not look anymore.

## June 4 2017 - 19:56 to 20:11
Looking to how to use ports.
Not a lot of progress

## June 4 2017 - 20:11 to 20:26
Got elm code calling JS code.
I need the path back

## June 4 2017 - 20:26 to 20:41
Got very close to having localstorage done.
Just a little but more...

## June 4 2017 - 20:41 to 20:56
Finally got it working!

I am also going to clean up the issue with how I am loading css.
Then I can start to work on actually implementing logged in functionality like liking and posting.

I should also get log out working.
I wonder how much i will need to include the token in requests
