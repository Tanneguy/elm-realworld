# elm-realworld
[INCOMPLETE]

> ### Elm codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with Elm including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

## Purpose
Even though a version for this app was made, I wanted to make my own and learn more about Elm.
I also wanted to try to track my progress with a log.

## Development

`elm-live --output=elm.js src/Main.elm --pushstate --open --debug`
